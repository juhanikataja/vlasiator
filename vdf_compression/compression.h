      If the flag is set to true the method will create a feedback loop where
  the weights of the MLP are stored and then re used for the next training
  session. This will? lead to faster convergence down the road. If the flag is
  set to false then every training session starts from randomized weights. I
  think this is what ML people call transfer learning (together with freezing
      and adding extra neuron which we do not do here).
